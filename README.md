# Crash-Course
Arrays, also called lists or
Vectors in some languages.
These are a series of values stored in memory.
To be able to find a particular value in this array, we have to specify an index.
Almost all programing languages start arrays at index 0, and use a square bracket syntax
to denote array access.
Arrays are extremely versatile data structures, used all the time, and so there are many functions
that can handle them to do useful things.
For example, pretty much every programming language comes with a built-in sort function,
where you just pass in your array, and it comes back sorted.
many programming languages have a string concatenation function, or “strcat”,
which takes in two strings, and copies the second one to the end of the first.
We can use arrays for making one dimensional lists, but sometimes you want to manipulate
data that is two dimensional, like a grid of numbers in a spreadsheet, or the pixels
on your computer screen.
For this, we need a Matrix.
