Electronic Computing: Crash Course Computer Science #2      Fundamentals of programming
One of the largest electro-mechanical computers built was the Harvard Mark I, completed in 1944 by IBM for the Allies during World War 2. It contained 765,000 components, three million connections, and five hundred miles of wire.
To keep its internal mechanics synchronized, it used a 50-foot shaft running right through the machine driven by a five horsepower motor.
Earliest uses for this technology was running simulations for the Manhattan Project.
Used relays: electrically-controlled mechanical switches
In a relay, there is a control wire that determines whether a circuit is opened or closed. The control wire connects to a coil of wire inside the relay. When current flows through the coil, an electromagneticfield is created, which in turn, attracts a metal arm inside the relay, snapping it shut and completing the circuit.
